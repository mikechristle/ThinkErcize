# Tile Match

### Instructions
The object of this game is to eliminate all the tiles as fast as possible.
Tiles have one of three colors, and one of three shaped inlays.
As each new tile is displayed on the left side, you must place it on the grid next to matching tiles.
If the new tile is tall then the colors must match.
If the new tile is wide then the inlays must match.
Matching tiles are then removed from the grid.

### Installation
Download all the files to a directory on your computer.
Don't forget the Images directory.
